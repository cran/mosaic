```{r include=FALSE}

# This loads the mosaic and dplyr packages

```{r include=FALSE}
# Some customization.  You can alter or delete as desired (if you know what you are doing).

# This changes the default colors in lattice plots.

## Using RMarkdown


### Text

Text can be decorated with **bold** or *italics*.  It is also possible to 

* create [links](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) 
* include mathematics like $e=mc^2$ or 
$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2$$


Be sure to put a space after the * when you are creating bullets and a space after # when 
creating section headers, but **not** between $ and the mathematical formulas.

### Graphics

If the code of an R chunk produces a plot, this plot can be displayed in the resulting file.
```{r}
xyplot(births ~ date, data=Births78)
```

### R output
Other forms of R output are also displayed as they are produced.
```{r}
favstats(~ births, data=Births78)
```

### Destination formats

This file can be knit to HTML, PDF, or Word.  In RStudio, just select the desired output file type
and click on `Knit HTML`, `Knit PDF`, or `Knit Word`.  Use the dropdown menu next to that to 
change the desired file type.
