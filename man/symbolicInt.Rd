\title{Find the symbolic integral of a formula}
\usage{
symbolicInt(form, ...)

symbolicAntiD(form, ...)

.intArith(form, ...)

.intMath(form, ...)

.intTrig(form, num, den, .x.)

.affine.exp(tree, .x.)
}
\arguments{
\item{form}{an object of type formula to be integrated.
Rhs of formula indicates which variable to
integrate with respect to.  Must only have one variable.}

\item{num}{numerator}

\item{den}{denominator}

\item{.x.}{the variable name}

\item{tree}{the expression to be analyzed}

\item{\ldots}{extra parameters}
}
\value{
symbolicInt returns a function whose body is the symbolic antiderivative of
the formula.  If this method does not recognize the formula, it will return an error.

a formula implementing giving symbolic anti-derivative.  If the formula
isn't found by the algorithm, an error is thrown.

An expression with the integral, or throws an error if unsuccessful.

An expression with the integral, or throws an error if unsuccessful.

An expression with the integral, or throws an error if unsuccessful.

A list with values of a and b satisfying a*.x.+b  = tree.
If the expression is not affine, returns an empty list.

\description{
Find the symbolic integral of a formula

Use recursion to find a symbolic antiderivative

Attempts symbolic integration of some mathematical/arithmetical forms

Attempts symbolic integration of some mathematical forms

Attempts symbolic integration of some mathematical forms using trigonometric substitution

Takes a call and returns its affine coefficients.
}
\details{
This symbolic integrator recognizes simple polynomials and functions such as
\code{sin}, \code{cos}, \code{tan}, \code{sinh}, \code{cosh}, \code{tanh}, \code{sqrt}, and \code{exp}.

It will not perform more complicated substitutions
or integration by parts.
