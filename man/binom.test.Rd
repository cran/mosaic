\arguments{
\item{x}{count of successes, length 2 vector of success and failure counts, a formula,
or a character, numeric, or factor vector containing raw data.}

\item{n}{sample size (successes + failures) or a data frame 
(for the formula interface)}

\item{p}{probability for null hypothesis}

\item{alternative}{type of alternative hypothesis}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level for confidence interval}

\item{ci.method}{a method to use for computing the confidence interval 
(case insensitive and may be abbreviated).  See details below.}

\item{data}{a data frame (if missing, \code{n} may be a data frame)}

\item{success}{level of variable to be considered success.  All other levels are 
considered failure.}

\item{...}{additional arguments (often ignored)}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{htest}
}
\description{
The \code{binom.test} function
performs an exact test of a simple null hypothesis about the probability of success in a 
Bernoulli experiment from summarized data or from raw data.
The mosaic \code{binom.test} provides wrapper functions around the function of the same name in \pkg{stats}.
These wrappers provide an extended interface (including formulas).
}
\details{
\code{binom.test} is a wrapper around \code{\link{binom.test}} from the \code{base} 
package to simplify its use when the raw data are available, in which case 
an extended syntax for \code{binom.test} is provided.  See the examples.

Also, five confidence interval methods are provided:
\describe{
\item{Clopper-Pearson, binom.test}{This is the interval produced when using \code{\link[stats]{binom.test}}
  from the \code{stats} package.  It guarantees a coverage rate at least as large as 
  the nominal coverage rate, but may produce wider intervals than some of the methods
  below, which may either under- or over-cover depending on the data.}
\item{Score, Wilson, prop.test}{This is the usual method used by \code{\link[stats]{prop.test}}
  and is computed by inverting p-values from score tests. It is often atrributed to 
  Edwin Wilson.}
  \item{Wald}{This is the interval traditionally taught in entry level statistics courses.
  It uses the sample proportion to estimate the standard error and uses normal
  theory to determine how many standard deviations to add and/or substract from
  the sample proportion to determine an interval.}
  \item{Agresti-Coull}{
  This is the Wald method after setting \eqn{n' = n + z^2} and 
  \eqn{p'= (x + z^2/2) / n}' and using \eqn{x' = n' p'} and \eqn{n'}
  in place of \eqn{x} and \eqn{n}.
  }
  \item{Plus4}{
  This is Wald after adding in two artifical success and two artificial failures.  It 
  is nearly the same as the Agresti-Coull method when the confidence level is 95%. since
  \eqn{z^2} is approximately 4 and \eqn{z^2/2} is approximately 2.}
  }
}
\note{
When \code{x} is a 0-1 vector, 0 is treated as failure and 1 as success. Similarly,
for a logical vector \code{TRUE} is treated as success and \code{FALSE} as failure.
