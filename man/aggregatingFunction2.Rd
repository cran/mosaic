\title{2-ary aggregating functions}
\usage{
aggregatingFunction2(fun)
}
\arguments{
\item{fun}{a function that takes two numeric vectors and computes a summary statistic,
returning a numeric vector of length 1.}
}
\value{
a function that generalizes \code{fun} to handle a formula/data frame interface.
}
\description{
\code{aggregatinFuntion2} creates statistical summaries of two numerical vectors that 
are formula aware.
}
\details{
This was designed to support functions like \code{cov()} which can be used to compute
numerical summaries from two numeric vectors.
The logic of the resulting function is this: 1) If the first two arguments are both formulas,
then those formulas are evaluated (with \code{data}) to compute the covariance; 
(2) If the first argument is a formula, and the second is \code{NULL}, 
then the left and ride sides of the formula and \code{data} are used to create the 
vectors passed to \code{fun};
(3) Else everything is simply passed to \code{fun} for evaluation.
}
\section{Note}{
 
Earlier versions of this function supported a "bare name + data frame" interface.  This
functionality has been removed since it was (a) ambiguous in some cases, (b) unnecessary, 
and (c) difficult to maintain.
