\title{Central portion of a distribution}
\usage{
cdist(dist, p, ..., verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dist}{a character string naming a distribution family (e.g., "norm").
This wil work for any family for which the usual d/p/q functions exist.}

\item{p}{the proportion to be in the central region, with equal proportions 
in either "tail".}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to the distribution functions.  Typically
these specify the parameters of the particular distribution desired.  See the examples.}

\item{verbose}{a logical indicating whether a more verbose output value should be returned.}
}
\value{
a pair of numbers indicating the upper and lower bounds, unless \code{verbose} is 
  \code{TRUE}, in which case a 1-row data frame is returned containing these bounds, 
  the central probability, the tail probabilities, and the name of the distribution.
}
\description{
This function determines the critial values for isolating 
a central portion of a distribution with a specified probability.
This is designed to work especially well for symmteric distributions,
but it can be used with any distribution.
}
\note{
This function is still experimental and changes the input or output
formats are possible in future versions of the package.

\examples{
cdist( "norm", .95)
cdist( "t", c(.90, .95, .99), df=5)
cdist( "t", c(.90, .95, .99), df=50)
cdist( "t", .95, df=c(3,5,10,20))
cdist( "t", .95, df=c(3,5,10,20), verbose = TRUE )
cdist( "norm", .95, mean=500, sd=100 )
cdist( "chisq", c(.90, .95), df=3 )
# CI
x <- rnorm(23, mean = 10, sd = 2)
cdist("t", p = 0.95, df=22)
mean(x) + cdist("t", p = 0.95, df=22) * sd(x) / sqrt(23)
confint(t.test(x))
cdist("t", p = 0.95, df=22, verbose = TRUE)
