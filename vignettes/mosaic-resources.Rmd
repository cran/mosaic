This vignette describes related resources and materials useful for teaching
statistics with a focus on modeling and computation.

## Package Vignettes

The `mosaic` package includes a number of vignettes. These are available 
from within R or from 
[cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic/](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic/).

 * *Minimal R* describes a minimal set of R commands for use in 
	Introductory Statistics and discusses why it is important
		to keep the set of commands small;
		
 * *Less Volume, More Creativity*, based on slides from an 
	ICOTS 2014 workshop, introduces the `mosaic` package and related tools 
	and describes some of the philosophy behind the design choices made in the 
	`mosaic` package. 
	
 * *Graphics with with the mosaic package* is gallery of plots made 
	using tools from the `mosaic` package.
	
 * *Resampling methods in R* demonstrates how to use the `mosaic`
	package to compute p-values for randomization tests and bootstrap confidence 
	intervals in a number of common situations. The examples are based on the 
	``resamping bake off'' at USCOTS 2013.

## Project MOSAIC Little Books

The following longer documents are available at 
[github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/LittleBooks](https://github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/LittleBooks/blob/master/README.md).

 * *Start Teaching Statistics Using R* includes 
some strategies for teaching beginners, and introduction to the `mosaic` package,
and some additional things that instructors should know about using R.

 * *A Student's Guide to R* provides a brief introduction to 
the R commands needed for all the basic statistical procedures in 
an Intro Stats course.


 * *Start R in Calculus* highlights features 
of R and the `mosaic` package that can be used to teach 
calculus with R.

 * *Start Modeling in R* (coming soon).
 
## Textbook Related

 * *Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach* (DT Kaplan, second edition)]
is an introduction to statistics embracing a modeling approach and employing 
resampling methods. 
The `mosaic` package is used throughout.

 * *Foundations and Applications of Statistics: An Introduction Using R* (R Pruim) 
is an R-infused probability and mathematical statistics text that emphasizes 
connections between probability and statistics. The book predates the `mosaic` package, 
but much of the code originally in the `fastR` package has been moved into the `mosaic` package.
